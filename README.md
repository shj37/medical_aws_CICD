A practical implementation of a RAG-powered AI assistant that understands and answers questions about specific course materials.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build, deploy, and maintain an AI assistant that:
- Understands course-specific content through Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Runs on AWS infrastructure with containerized components
- Features automated CI/CD workflows via GitHub Actions
- Follows LLMOps best practices for AI application lifecycle management

## Key Features

- **Content Ingestion Pipeline**: Processes course materials (PDFs, videos, slides) into a vector database
- **RAG Implementation**: Enhances LLM responses with relevant course knowledge
- **AWS Infrastructure**: Leverages managed services for scalability and reliability
- **CI/CD Automation**: Includes testing, deployment, and monitoring
- **Docker Containers**: Ensures consistency across development and production

## Use Cases

- Student support outside of class hours
- Personalized learning assistants for self-paced courses
- Teaching assistant augmentation for large courses
- Supplementary resource for complex technical subjects
